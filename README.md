`models` consists of model Schema, `camp.js`.</br>
`seeds` Consists of three files called `cities.js`,`index.js` and `places.js`.</br>
`seeds` directory is used to get literal raw data which is used in `index.js`, the data has been formatted and stored in the database under the collections camp-in which can be viewed in `index.js`</br>
### Confusion can be created with `index.js` and `index.ejs`. Please be careful at looking over the extensions, reliance on template can be problematic sometimes.
